Project Description:

A C program that applies a grayscale, sepia, or a blur filter to BMP images. The program takes command-line arguments to specify the filter and input/output BMP files. 

Features:

Reads and writes 24-bit uncompressed BMP files.

Applies one of the three filters based on user input.

Preserves BMP header information while modifying pixel data.

Files:

filter.c: The main C source file that implements the image filters.

helpers.c: Contains the filter functions (grayscale, sepia, blur, edges).

helpers.h: Header file with function prototypes for the filters.

bmp.h: Header file defining BMP file structures.

images/: Folder containing sample BMP files for testing (e.g., sample.bmp).

README.md: This file, explaining the project and how to run it.

How to Run:
